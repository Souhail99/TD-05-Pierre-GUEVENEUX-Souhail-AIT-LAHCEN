# TD-05-Pierre-GUEVENEUX-Souhail-AIT-LAHCEN
First of all, we had to install truffle, ganache etc for the TD, we didn't have any problems because Pierre already had everything necessary on his computer.

For exercise 1, we had received our token with the ticker this token had to be put in the code and the associated ticker too. But during the validation for the exercise we encountered a problem which was that exercise 2 asked for an address as a parameter when it was wrong. So why? because we had used the old contract and not the new one. 

For the rest of the exercise we used the new contact, from exercise 2 to 9, we had to use a contract that we had created and modified in order to be able to answer the "requires" requested. In this way, on Vs Code we could see these requirements and adapt ourselves accordingly.
